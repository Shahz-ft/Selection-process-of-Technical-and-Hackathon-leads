        <p>The story so far.
            The FOSS United Foundation, founded in 2020, is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects and communities in India. It carries forward the legacy of the ERPNext foundation established in 2016, with similar objectives. Initiated through a collaboration between Frappe, the team behind ERPNext - one of Indiaâ€™s most significant FOSS projects, and Zerodha, the foundation has been a catalyst for open-source innovation.
            
            Initially led by Vishal Arya as a one-person-army, the foundation has expanded over three and a half years to a diverse group of 10 members, including interns, fellows, and both full-time and part-time employees. This growth is supported by an extensive network of enthusiastic volunteers across India, each contributing passionately to our mission of enhancing the FOSS landscape in the country.</p>
